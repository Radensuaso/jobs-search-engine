Module 7 - D3 Jobs Search Engine

    You are in charge of building a "Search Engine" for Job Posting.
    The application should have a search page where the user can input the desired position and retrieve
    relevant results.

   *START FROM MONDAY'S WORK*
   
    Today's task is to add a Redux store to your project, and give the user the ability to set as "favourite" as many companies as he/she likes.
    This favourite companies list must be entirely saved in the redux store, and rendered in a separate page
    (create a route on /favourites, for example).
    Also link your company detail page on every entry in this favourites page, just like you did on the main results.
    
    // EXTRA
    - Allow the user to also remove a company from his/her favourites.
    - Handle every error that you can think of by using redux actions and reducers (eg. {type: "SET_ERROR", payload: "404"}) 
    and display it by reading the global state to inform the user.
