Jobs Search Engine
You are in charge of building a "Search Engine" for Remote Jobs.

The application should have a search page where the user can input the desired position and retrieve relevant results.

 

From the results, every company name should be clickable and redirect to a /company-detail the page where all the jobs from that company are listed.
